# pandas and scikit-learn were mentioned as optional, not explicitly added to core PoC.
# If they were used in prediction_service.py (the PoC used a manual SMA), they'd be here.
# For the current PoC, pandas was imported but not strictly necessary for the simple SMA.
# If it becomes a hard dependency, it should be added.
# Let's assume the simple SMA in prediction_service.py did not *require* pandas.
# If it did, this would be:
# pandas==2.0.3 # Example version
